# Solvency Altman's z-Score

the cut off score is a (5):
1. a Financial company Indicator,
2. a Linear equation: formed off an **accounting Ratios**
3. _Seems to be a **success**, across the centuries (since its debut)_

4. An Indicator for calculating a company's distress (i.e. _solvency_)
5. This model relies on five (5) different Accounting Ratios

This model assumes:
1. All data are correct ( no scenario for `data manipulation`)
2.  No additional, Sudden Emergency Cash Inflows (i.e. `Bank loans`, or `bonds` )

Hence, although it  this model is not, by no means, realistic, on it's own
