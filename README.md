![330px-Zscore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20923018/144329325-06c5f0ae-5c47-49c6-93e6-bae7d1eea3e3.jpg)

An Indicator for calculating a company's distress a.k.a soulvency. 
this model relies on accumulation of  5 differnt Accounting Ratios 


this model assumes:
-  All data are correct ( no scenario for data manipulation) 
-  No additional, Sudden Emergency surge of Cash Inflows (i.e. Bank loans, or bonds , ..etc)

## Predictability 
relying on Logic: it is  found to be around 72% accurate (back in 1969)


###  Warning 
This model is for educational use only.
as the formula is unrelieabe and does NOT reflect the current market (with its new Products)  
this model is ancinet: it does not Factor in **'Technological Progress'**, nor  including the **'Personal Computer'**, nor **Algorithmic Trading** nor the **'Internet '** itself

e.g. it is easier and faster, nowadays, to get an additional loan, or to issue a bond to the market.

thus, certain changes must be 'Made' in order to Update the model itself...
on the other hand, the Creditor may ask the company in question for additional information: i.e. ratios (similar to the one used in the making of _the Altman's Z-Score Formula_ )
 it could prove to be _Useful_, but to some _extent_
