An Indicator for calculating a company's distress a.k.a soulvency. 
this model relies on accumulation of  5 differnt Accounting Ratios 


this model assumes:
-  All data are correct ( no scenario for data manipulation) 
-  No additional, Sudden Emergency Cash Inflows (i.e. Bank loans, or bonds 

## Predictability 
As it relies on Logic. it is found to be found to be 72% accurate

###  Warning 
This model is for educational use only.
as the formula is unrelieabe and does NOT reflect the current market (with its new Products)  
this model is ancinet, it does not Factor in **'Technological Progress'**, nor the **'Personal Computer'**, nor the **'Internet Revolution'** itself

e.g. it is easier and faster, nowadays, to get an additional loan, or to issue a bond to the market , thus certain changes must be 'Made' in order to Update the model itself.
on the other hand, the creditor may ask the company in question for additional information: i.e. ratios similar to the one used in the making of _the Altman's Z-Score Formula_
thus, it could prove to be _Useful_, to some _extent_
